# Game Jam

Games are an area that have been heavily influence by developments in AI and ML. In this assignment, write a short paper on a game that you like that has been influenced by the evolution of AI. It should be an old enough game to have been influenced by several types of computer processing systems. A good example is Chess or Go, but also take a look at video games like pong or Pac-Man. Write an essay that discusses the game's past, present, and AI future.



## The Evolution of AI in Football Games: From Predictable to Proactive

Early iterations of FIFA, now known as EA FC, featured AI that felt more like a pre-programmed script than a real opponent. Defenders would lunge into predictable tackles, and attackers would make robotic runs regardless of the on-field situation. This resulted in gameplay that lacked nuance and became frustratingly repetitive. The introduction of difficulty levels offered a turning point. Higher difficulties presented a more complex AI, with players reacting dynamically to the flow of the game. They'd attempt smarter tackles, adjust their positioning based on the situation, and exploit defensive weaknesses with intelligent runs. This shift towards adaptive AI created a more realistic and engaging experience for players.

The "Active Intelligence System" introduced in FIFA 17 marked a significant leap forward. This system focused on improving the attacking movement and decision-making of AI players. Players could now analyze the positioning of defenders and teammates, creating space or exploiting gaps with intelligent runs. They also learned to anticipate passes, leading to a more fluid and unpredictable attacking style. Machine learning has further enhanced AI by analyzing player data and team formations. This allows developers to create AI opponents with realistic managerial styles. For instance, a virtual "Jos√© Mourinho" might prioritize a defensive approach with quick counter-attacks, while a "Pep Guardiola" might focus on possession-based play with intricate passing patterns. This level of customization further enhances the realism and replayability of the game.

The future of AI in EA FC promises even more exciting possibilities. Advancements in machine learning and deep learning could lead to AI players capable of real-time learning and adaptation. Imagine an AI opponent that analyzes your playing style and adjusts tactics accordingly, forcing you to constantly strategize. AI could even be used to generate emergent narratives within the game. Perhaps an AI player could develop a personal rivalry with your star striker, leading to more intense on-field battles. However, developers will need to strike a careful balance to ensure a fair and enjoyable experience for players of all skill levels. Overly aggressive AI, for instance, could become frustrating. As AI technology continues to evolve, we can expect even more exciting developments in EA FC, blurring the lines between game and reality.
